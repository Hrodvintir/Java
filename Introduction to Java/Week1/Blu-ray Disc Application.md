# Blu-ray Disc Application Development with Java ME, Part 1: Creating Your First Application

For those curious about the Java aspects of Blu-Ray, here is a two part series of articles, originally provided by Sun.

Part1: [Creating Your First Application](https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/javabluray.html)

Part 2: [Responding to User Input](https://web.archive.org/web/20090204134251/http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/javame/bluray/part2/index.html)

The second part is via the Wayback Machine, because as with so many other Java links from Sun's web site, it seems to have been lost.
