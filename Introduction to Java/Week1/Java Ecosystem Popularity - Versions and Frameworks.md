# Java Ecosystem Popularity - Versions and Frameworks
The snyk company produces an annual JVM ecosystem report.  Their 2020 report identified a few items of interest:

36% of developers had switched from Oracle JDK to OpenJDK due to Oracle's licensing changes.

64% of developers are using Java 8.  Only 25% use Java 11.  Those are the current LTS (Long-Term Support) releases.  Although, some took issue with the change in licensing, the primary reasons appear to be that Java 8 works just fine, and Java 11 not only offers nothing significant enough to inspire migration, but actually removed almost 2000 classes from the Standard Library.

60% of developers use Spring.

Based on this, one should expect Java 8 LTS to be around for a very long time, which is well-confirmed by the support plans, which state that Java 8 will be supported for years after Java 11 LTS is long gone.
