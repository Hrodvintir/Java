# Creating Calculator Objects

### Objective
This lab will continue to work with the Calculator classes you created earlier. This system is a set of classes that perform basic math-oriented calculations. You will utilize the existing Java and Math class functionality to implement these classes and it will provide practice in creating classes, methods and attributes.

### Overview
In this lab you will:

Implement your methods

### Create a test class

Test all of your methods

## Step by Step Instructions
{You may also download a copy of these instructions via the link at the bottom of this page.}  

### Exercise 1: Implement methods

Currently, most methods in the Calculator classes return 0. Using the functionality provided in the Math class, implement each of the methods by following these instructions.

#### 1. Scientific Calculator:

  a. Use the Math class to implement the following methods.

    i. exp() which has one parameter of type double and returns a double [This method will be used to calculate e^x]

    ii. log() which has one parameter of type double and returns a double [This method will be used to calculate ln x]

#### 2. Trigonometric Calculator:

  a. Use the Math class to implement the following methods.

    i. sine()

    ii. cosine()

    iii. tangent()

    iV. arcsine()

    V. arccosine()

    Vi. arctangent()

#### 3. Test your work:

  a. Create a new class named CalculatorDriver in the com.javaoo.calculators package.

  b. Ensure that this class has a main() method.

  c. Instantiate each of your Calculator classes in the main() method and call each of the methods above to ensure they are working correctly.  Use print statements to verify correct operation.
