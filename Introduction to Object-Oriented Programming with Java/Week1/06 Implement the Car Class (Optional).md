# Implement the Car Class (Optional)

This Lab Is Optional.  The Solution is in the Demos project.
 - Recreate the Car class that we explored during lecture.

 - Provide setters and getters for all properties.  Notice that there is something different about the name used for the engineState getter.

 - Provide a main method, and your own list of cars to play with.

 - Make sure that you can print them, using printf.  The content of what you print is up to you.
