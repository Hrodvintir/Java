# Formatting Output using PrintStream

In the lesson's demo, we saw the use of the [printf](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/PrintStream.html#printf(java.lang.String,%20java.lang.Object...)) method on System.out.  System.out is a [PrintStream](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/PrintStream.html), and we can use the printf or format methods interchangeably.

The official Java Tutorial provides further [information on using printf](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/data/numberformat.html) to display information to the console.

Take time to review printf, because you'll be wanting to use it.  A lot.
