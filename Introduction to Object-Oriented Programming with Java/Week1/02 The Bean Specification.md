# The Bean Specification

This course covers the basics that are typically used by developers and used by most frameworks.  But the [JavaBeans Specification](https://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/jcp/7224-javabeans-1.01-fr-spec-oth-JSpec/beans.101.pdf?AuthParam=1596756008_2f2bdcce270ee3b3b750fb904b12948f) is over 100 pages long, and provides a much richer environment than most developers know and most frameworks leverage.  Amongst the topics not covered in this course are:

Indexed Properties

Change Notification

Vetoable Changes

Events

Persistence

Property Editors

If you wish to master the subject of JavaBeans, you will want to read the specification, or at least review it to get an idea of what is provided, and know where to look if and when you need the details.
